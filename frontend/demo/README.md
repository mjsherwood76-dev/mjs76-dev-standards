# Developer Standards Showcase

Static demonstration page for the UI/theming standards.

## Getting Started

1. From the repo root run a simple static server (any option works):
   ```powershell
   cd frontend/demo
   npx serve .
   ```
   or open `index.html` directly in your browser.
2. Use the control panel at the top to switch color modes, style themes, and density.
3. Inspect the examples (buttons, cards, forms, alerts, tokens) to verify how each theme’s tokens influence the UI.

The CSS is sourced from `design/ui-standards.md`, so any changes to the canonical tokens should be mirrored here to keep the showcase accurate.
